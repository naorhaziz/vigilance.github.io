Our rules of engagement are reviewed by international law experts before every operation.\n\n2/ Unlike our adversaries, we take unprecedented steps to minimize civilian casualties: roof-knocking, phone warnings, leaflet drops, evacuation corridors.\n\n3/ Hamas deliberately operates from civilian areas. This is not opinion - it's documented by UN, Amnesty International, and independent journalists.\n\n4/ The IDF-to-civilian casualty ratio in Gaza is lower than NATO operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, or Syria. These are verified by independent military analysts.\n\n5/ We don't celebrate civilian deaths. We mourn every innocent life lost. Hamas celebrates and fabricates numbers.\n\n6/ Recent claims of 'war crimes' lack evidence, context, and ignore Hamas's documented use of human shields.\n\n7/ We invite international observers, cooperate with investigations, and hold soldiers accountable when rules are violated.\n\n8/ Our enemies operate from hospitals, schools, and mosques - all documented. They prevent civilians from evacuating - all documented.\n\n9/ The real war crime is using civilians as shields while firing rockets at our civilian population.\n\n10/ We will continue operating within international law while defending our people.

As someone who's studied military operations for 20 years, the misinformation about IDF operations is stunning.\n\n🧵 THREAD:\n\n1/ Urban warfare is the most difficult military challenge. Civilian presence makes every decision fraught with moral complexity.\n\n2/ The IDF's civilian casualty ratio is 1:1 to 1.5:1 (civilian to combatant). Compare this to:\n- Mosul (ISIS): 10:1\n- Raqqa: 8:1  \n- Aleppo: 12:1\n\n3/ How? Warning systems. The IDF calls, texts, drops leaflets, and uses 'roof knocking' before strikes. No other military does this at scale.\n\n4/ 'But hospitals!' Hamas stores weapons in hospitals. This isn't Israeli propaganda - it's documented by the UN, journalists, even their own videos.\n\n5/ International law ALLOWS strikes on civilian infrastructure if it's being used for military purposes. The law also says the party using civilians as shields bears responsibility.\n\n6/ Every IDF airstrike is approved by legal advisors. Every target is reviewed for proportionality. This is not standard in most militaries.\n\n7/ The fabricated casualty numbers are a strategy. Remember Al-Ahli Hospital? Headlines screamed '500 dead' - turned out to be a Hamas rocket, ~50 casualties.\n\n8/ By the time corrections come, the damage is done. The lie spreads globally while the truth limps behind.\n\n9/ Hamas's strategy REQUIRES civilian casualties. They fire from schools HOPING for return fire. They film it. They inflate numbers. They weaponize sympathy.\n\n10/ None of this means civilians aren't dying. War is horrific. But legal ≠ moral, and moral ≠ comfortable.\n\n11/ The IDF operates within international law. Period. No Western military has faced this operational challenge with these constraints.\n\n12/ If you're outraged, ask: Who started this war? Who uses civilians as shields? Who fires rockets at civilian populations? Who celebrates terrorism?\n\n13/ The asymmetry isn't just military - it's moral. One side tries to minimize civilian deaths. The other side weaponizes them.\n\n14/ You don't have to like Israel's politics to recognize the IDF operates legally and with unprecedented caution in impossible circumstances.\n\n15/ Read the Geneva Conventions. Read international law. Compare to other conflicts. The facts are clear. #UrbanWarfare #InternationalLaw #FactCheck",

Our justice system treats Jewish extremism as the crime it is.\n\n3/ Recent cases: 3 settlers received prison sentences (2-7 years) for attacks on Palestinian property. Appeals were denied. Justice system is functioning.\n\n4/ Context matters: Settler violence (~500 incidents/year) exists alongside Palestinian terrorism (~3,000 incidents/year). Both are wrong. Both are prosecuted.\n\n5/ The extremists represent <1% of 450,000 settlers. Vast majority are law-abiding citizens: teachers, doctors, families. Don't judge communities by their worst actors.\n\n6/ Israeli civil society - including settler leaders and rabbis - actively condemns violence. This is a shared Israeli value across political spectrum.\n\n7/ We've increased IDF presence in hotspot areas, established special investigation units, and streamlined prosecution processes.

No. Witness intimidation, sympathetic local courts, and regional politics create challenges. Israel's own legal experts acknowledge this.\n\n4/ But claiming 'Israel encourages settler violence' contradicts the documented enforcement actions, public condemnations, and prison sentences.\n\n5/ Statistical reality: ~500 settler violence incidents/year vs ~3,000 Palestinian attacks on Israelis. Media coverage ratio: 8:1 focused on settler violence.\n\n6/ This isn't whataboutism - it's asking why international community applies different standards. Violence is violence. Both should be condemned equally.\n\n7/ The 'encouragement' narrative ignores: Israeli Supreme Court rulings against extremists, demolition of illegal outposts, settler leaders condemning violence.\n\n8/ Extremists exist in every society - including Israeli settler communities. They represent <1% of 450,000 settlers. Collective blame is lazy analysis.\n\n9/ Yes, some Israeli politicians enable extremism through rhetoric. That's a legitimate criticism. But it's not the same as official policy 'encouraging' violence.\n\n10/ Israeli security establishment views settler violence as threat to stability and international standing. Strategic interest is in preventing it, not enabling it.\n\n11/ The conversation should be: How can Israel improve enforcement? How can Palestinian Authority reciprocate? How do we break the cycle?\n\n12/ Instead we get: 'Israel = apartheid = settler violence.' That's not analysis. That's activism pretending to be journalism. We can do better.",

Let's talk honestly about password sharing and why we made this change. 🧵\n\n1/ For years, we looked the other way on password sharing. But as content costs skyrocketed (+40% since 2020), we had to make tough choices.\n\n2/ Your favorite shows aren't cheap: Stranger Things = $30M/episode. Squid Game = $21M for S1. We invest $17B annually in content YOU love.\n\n3/ Password sharing costs the industry ~$6B/year. That's content that doesn't get made, shows that get canceled.\n\n4/ We're not alone - Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max all have similar policies. It's industry standard.\n\n5/ We're offering the most affordable option: Add a member for $7.99/month. That's less than a single movie ticket.\n\n6/ Bottom line: We want to keep making the shows you love. This helps us do that sustainably. We appreciate your understanding. ❤️",

Let's talk about why this happens. 🧵\n\n2/ Here's the reality: We don't own most licensed shows. Studios loan them to us for specific time periods. When contracts end, we either renew at new (much higher) rates or let them go.\n\n3/ Example: The Office's final license cost us $100M/year. That's more than we spent on entire seasons of Stranger Things, The Crown, or Wednesday - shows that stay on Netflix forever.\n\n4/ Here's what changed: Studios like NBC/Universal, Paramount, Warner Bros. all launched their own streaming services. They're taking their shows back to boost their platforms. It's not about us - it's industry-wide.\n\n5/ Our choice: Spend hundreds of millions renting shows temporarily OR invest that money in original content we own permanently. We chose to build a library that's uniquely Netflix.\n\n6/ Since 2020, we've released 850+ original series and films. Quality's improved too - our originals now score 40% higher in audience satisfaction vs. 2019. That's your subscription dollars at work.\n\n7/ The shows leaving? They hurt. But what's coming? A library of content that stays, evolves, and belongs to the Netflix community. That's the trade-off. We think it's worth it.",

Studios literally own the shows, and they're launching their own platforms. They want their content back. We can't force them to renew, and honestly, the prices they're asking are insane.\n\nWe're not perfect, but here's what we ARE doing: Investing $17 billion/year in content we own. That means shows like Stranger Things, Wednesday, Squid Game, The Crown - they're not going anywhere. Ever. Compare that to licensing The Office for $100M/year just to have it yanked away.\n\nI get the nostalgia factor. Comfort shows are real. But would you rather pay for a rotating library of rentals, or a growing library of originals that actually stay? We chose option B. Not everyone will agree with that call, and that's fair.\n\nWhat would genuinely help: Tell us what genres/types of shows you want MORE of. We're listening, and that feedback directly influences what we greenlight.",
