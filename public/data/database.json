Let's talk honestly about password sharing and why we made this change. 🧵\n\n1/ For years, we looked the other way on password sharing. But as content costs skyrocketed (+40% since 2020), we had to make tough choices.\n\n2/ Your favorite shows aren't cheap: Stranger Things = $30M/episode. Squid Game = $21M for S1. We invest $17B annually in content YOU love.\n\n3/ Password sharing costs the industry ~$6B/year. That's content that doesn't get made, shows that get canceled.\n\n4/ We're not alone - Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max all have similar policies. It's industry standard.\n\n5/ We're offering the most affordable option: Add a member for $7.99/month. That's less than a single movie ticket.\n\n6/ Bottom line: We want to keep making the shows you love. This helps us do that sustainably. We appreciate your understanding. ❤️",
